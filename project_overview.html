            <h3>Page Design:</h3>
            <p>For each of the five required pages (Home and four others), here is a breakdown of their design:</p>

            <h4>1. Home Page (index.html)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Purpose of the Page:</strong> To provide a welcoming introduction to Cozy Corner Cafe, highlight key offerings, and encourage visitors to explore the rest of the website.</li>
                <li><strong>Audience/Users of Page:</strong> New and returning customers, local residents, and visitors searching for a cafe.</li>
                <li><strong>Content of the Page:</strong> Cafe name and logo, a hero section with a welcoming message ("Your neighborhood haven for delicious coffee...") and an image of the cafe's interior, brief highlights of menu items (e.g., "Try our signature Caramel Macchiato"), a call to action button ("View Our Menu"), and potentially a small section with operating hours.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Entry Fields:</strong> None anticipated for the homepage.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Validation:</strong> Not applicable.</li>
                <li><strong>Buttons/Hyperlinks/Drop Downs:</strong> Navigation links to other pages (Menu, About Us, Contact, Testimonials), and a button like "View Our Menu" linking to `menu.html`.</li>
                <li><strong>Actions on the Page:</strong> Clicking navigation links will lead to other pages. Clicking the "View Our Menu" button will lead to the Menu page.</li>
                <li><strong>Special Notes:</strong> The homepage should be visually appealing with warm colors and inviting imagery, reflecting the "cozy" theme.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>2. Menu (menu.html)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Purpose of the Page:</strong> To display the cafe's offerings, including coffee, pastries, sandwiches, and any other items with descriptions and prices.</li>
                <li><strong>Audience/Users of Page:</strong> Potential and returning customers interested in knowing what the cafe offers and their prices before visiting or ordering (if future functionality allows).</li>
                <li><strong>Content of the Page:</strong> Organized into sections like "Coffee & Espresso," "Pastries," "Sandwiches & Bites." Each item will list its name and price, with a short, enticing description. Small images might accompany some items.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Entry Fields:</strong> None anticipated for the menu page in this phase.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Validation:</strong> Not applicable.</li>
                <li><strong>Buttons/Hyperlinks/Drop Downs:</strong> Navigation links to other pages. Categories might be visually separated with headings.</li>
                <li><strong>Actions on the Page:</strong> Clicking navigation links will lead to other pages.</li>
                <li><strong>Special Notes:</strong> The menu should be easy to browse on both desktop and mobile devices. Clear categorization is important.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>3. About Us (about.html)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Purpose of the Page:</strong> To tell the story of Cozy Corner Cafe, highlighting its passion for quality coffee, community focus, and the friendly atmosphere it aims to create.</li>
                <li><strong>Audience/Users of Page:</strong> Customers curious about the cafe's background, values, and the people behind it.</li>
                <li><strong>Content of the Page:</strong> A narrative about how the cafe started, its mission to be a neighborhood gathering spot, information about the sourcing of coffee beans and fresh ingredients, and perhaps a photo of the staff or the founders.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Entry Fields:</strong> None anticipated for the about us page.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Validation:</strong> Not applicable.</li>
                <li><strong>Buttons/Hyperlinks/Drop Downs:</strong> Navigation links to other pages. Potentially links to the cafe's social media profiles.</li>
                <li><strong>Actions on the Page:</strong> Clicking navigation links will lead to other pages. Clicking social media links will open those platforms.</li>
                <li><strong>Special Notes:</strong> The tone should be warm, personal, and inviting, reinforcing the "cozy" brand.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>4. Contact (contact.html)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Purpose of the Page:</strong> To provide all necessary information for customers to easily get in touch with Cozy Corner Cafe.</li>
                <li><strong>Audience/Users of Page:</strong> Customers with inquiries, feedback, or those needing directions or hours of operation.</li>
                <li><strong>Content of the Page:</strong> The cafe's full address (123 Main Street, Charlotte, NC 28202) with an embedded Google Map, phone number ((704) 555-9876), email address (info@cozycornercafe.com), and operating hours (Mon-Fri: 7am-6pm, Sat-Sun: 8am-4pm). A simple contact form with fields for Name, Email, and Message will be included.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Entry Fields:</strong> Name, Email, Message (in the contact form).</li>
                <li><strong>Data Validation:</strong> Basic client-side validation using JavaScript to ensure that Name and Message fields are not empty and that the Email field has a valid format.</li>
                <li><strong>Buttons/Hyperlinks/Drop Downs:</strong> Navigation links to other pages and a "Send Message" button for the contact form. The address might be hyperlinked to open in a map service.</li>
                <li><strong>Actions on the Page:</strong> Clicking navigation links will lead to other pages. Clicking the "Send Message" button (while not having full backend functionality in this phase) will trigger the client-side validation. Clicking the address might open a map.</li>
                <li><strong>Special Notes:</strong> The contact information should be prominently displayed and easy to find.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>5. Testimonials (testimonials.html)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Purpose of the Page:</strong> To build trust and credibility by showcasing positive feedback from satisfied Cozy Corner Cafe customers.</li>
                <li><strong>Audience/Users of Page:</strong> Potential new customers who are looking for reassurance about the quality of the cafe's offerings and service.</li>
                <li><strong>Content of the Page:</strong> Several short quotes from happy customers, each attributed with their name (e.g., "The coffee is fantastic! - Sarah M."). Potentially, a visually appealing layout with different formatted blocks for each testimonial.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Entry Fields:</strong> While a form to submit testimonials could be envisioned for future development, it won't be functional in this phase.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Validation:</strong> Not applicable in this phase.</li>
                <li><strong>Buttons/Hyperlinks/Drop Downs:</strong> Navigation links to other pages.</li>
                <li><strong>Actions on the Page:</strong> Clicking navigation links will lead to other pages.</li>
                <li><strong>Special Notes:</strong> Real and positive testimonials can be very persuasive. The design should make them easy to read.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Dynamic Functionality on the Website:</h3>
            <p>Here is a description of the dynamic functionality I plan to implement using JavaScript/jQuery on the website:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Simple Image Carousel on the Homepage:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Page:</strong> index.html</li>
                        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To showcase multiple appealing images of the cafe in a limited space on the homepage, creating visual interest and highlighting different aspects of the cafe (e.g., coffee preparation, pastries, ambiance).</li>
                        <li><strong>Example URLs:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_slideshow.asp" target="_blank">W3Schools JavaScript Slideshow Example</a></li>
                                </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Client-Side Form Validation on the Contact Page:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Page:</strong> contact.html</li>
                        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To enhance the user experience by providing immediate feedback if the contact form is filled out incorrectly (e.g., missing required fields, invalid email format) before submission is attempted.</li>
                        <li><strong>Example URLs:</strong>
                            <ul>

                                </ul>

                    </ul>
                </li>
