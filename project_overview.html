            <h4>1. Home Page (index.html)</h4>
            <ul>

                <li><strong>Data Entry Fields:</strong> None anticipated for the homepage.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Validation:</strong> Not applicable.</li>
                <li><strong>Buttons/Hyperlinks/Drop Downs:</strong> Navigation links to other pages (Menu, About Us, Contact, Testimonials), and a button like "View Our Menu" linking to `menu.html`.</li>

                <li><strong>Audience/Users of Page:</strong> Potential and returning customers interested in knowing what the cafe offers and their prices before visiting or ordering (if future functionality allows).</li>
                <li><strong>Content of the Page:</strong> Organized into sections like "Coffee & Espresso," "Pastries," "Sandwiches & Bites." Each item will list its name and price, with a short, enticing description. Small images might accompany some items.</li>
