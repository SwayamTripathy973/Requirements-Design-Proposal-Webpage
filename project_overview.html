            <h3>Page Design:</h3>
            <p>For each of the five required pages (Home and four others), here is a breakdown of their design:</p>

            <h4>1. Home Page (index.html)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Purpose of the Page:</strong> To provide a welcoming introduction to Cozy Corner Cafe, highlight key offerings, and encourage visitors to explore the rest of the website.</li>
                <li><strong>Audience/Users of Page:</strong> New and returning customers, local residents, and visitors searching for a cafe.</li>
                <li><strong>Content of the Page:</strong> Cafe name and logo, a hero section with a welcoming message ("Your neighborhood haven for delicious coffee...") and an image of the cafe's interior, brief highlights of menu items (e.g., "Try our signature Caramel Macchiato"), a call to action button ("View Our Menu"), and potentially a small section with operating hours.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Entry Fields:</strong> None anticipated for the homepage.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Validation:</strong> Not applicable.</li>
                <li><strong>Buttons/Hyperlinks/Drop Downs:</strong> Navigation links to other pages (Menu, About Us, Contact, Testimonials), and a button like "View Our Menu" linking to `menu.html`.</li>
                <li><strong>Actions on the Page:</strong> Clicking navigation links will lead to other pages. Clicking the "View Our Menu" button will lead to the Menu page.</li>
                <li><strong>Special Notes:</strong> The homepage should be visually appealing with warm colors and inviting imagery, reflecting the "cozy" theme.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>2. Menu (menu.html)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Purpose of the Page:</strong> To display the cafe's offerings, including coffee, pastries, sandwiches, and any other items with descriptions and prices.</li>
                <li><strong>Audience/Users of Page:</strong> Potential and returning customers interested in knowing what the cafe offers and their prices before visiting or ordering (if future functionality allows).</li>
                <li><strong>Content of the Page:</strong> Organized into sections like "Coffee & Espresso," "Pastries," "Sandwiches & Bites." Each item will list its name and price, with a short, enticing description. Small images might accompany some items.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Entry Fields:</strong> None anticipated for the menu page in this phase.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Validation:</strong> Not applicable.</li>
                <li><strong>Buttons/Hyperlinks/Drop Downs:</strong> Navigation links to other pages. Categories might be visually separated with headings.</li>
                <li><strong>Actions on the Page:</strong> Clicking navigation links will lead to other pages.</li>
                <li><strong>Special Notes:</strong> The menu should be easy to browse on both desktop and mobile devices. Clear categorization is important.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>3. About Us (about.html)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Purpose of the Page:</strong> To tell the story of Cozy Corner Cafe, highlighting its passion for quality coffee, community focus, and the friendly atmosphere it aims to create.</li>
                <li><strong>Audience/Users of Page:</strong> Customers curious about the cafe's background, values, and the people behind it.</li>
                <li><strong>Content of the Page:</strong> A narrative about how the cafe started, its mission to be a neighborhood gathering spot, information about the sourcing of coffee beans and fresh ingredients, and perhaps a photo of the staff or the founders.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Entry Fields:</strong> None anticipated for the about us page.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Validation:</strong> Not applicable.</li>
                <li><strong>Buttons/Hyperlinks/Drop Downs:</strong> Navigation links to other pages. Potentially links to the cafe's social media profiles.</li>
                <li><strong>Actions on the Page:</strong> Clicking navigation links will lead to other pages. Clicking social media links will open those platforms.</li>
                <li><strong>Special Notes:</strong> The tone should be warm, personal, and inviting, reinforcing the "cozy" brand.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>4. Contact (contact.html)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Purpose of the Page:</strong> To provide all necessary information for customers to easily get in touch with Cozy Corner Cafe.</li>
                <li><strong>Audience/Users of Page:</strong> Customers with inquiries, feedback, or those needing directions or hours of operation.</li>
                <li><strong>Content of the Page:</strong> The cafe's full address (123 Main Street, Charlotte, NC 28202) with an embedded Google Map, phone number ((704) 555-9876), email address (info@cozycornercafe.com), and operating hours (Mon-Fri: 7am-6pm, Sat-Sun: 8am-4pm). A simple contact form with fields for Name, Email, and Message will be included.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Entry Fields:</strong> Name, Email, Message (in the contact form).</li>
                <li><strong>Data Validation:</strong> Basic client-side validation using JavaScript to ensure that Name and Message fields are not empty and that the Email field has a valid format.</li>
                <li><strong>Buttons/Hyperlinks/Drop Downs:</strong> Navigation links to other pages and a "Send Message" button for the contact form. The address might be hyperlinked to open in a map service.</li>
                <li><strong>Actions on the Page:</strong> Clicking navigation links will lead to other pages. Clicking the "Send Message" button (while not having full backend functionality in this phase) will trigger the client-side validation. Clicking the address might open a map.</li>
                <li><strong>Special Notes:</strong> The contact information should be prominently displayed and easy to find.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>5. Testimonials (testimonials.html)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Purpose of the Page:</strong> To build trust and credibility by showcasing positive feedback from satisfied Cozy Corner Cafe customers.</li>
                <li><strong>Audience/Users of Page:</strong> Potential new customers who are looking for reassurance about the quality of the cafe's offerings and service.</li>
                <li><strong>Content of the Page:</strong> Several short quotes from happy customers, each attributed with their name (e.g., "The coffee is fantastic! - Sarah M."). Potentially, a visually appealing layout with different formatted blocks for each testimonial.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Entry Fields:</strong> While a form to submit testimonials could be envisioned for future development, it won't be functional in this phase.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Validation:</strong> Not applicable in this phase.</li>
                <li><strong>Buttons/Hyperlinks/Drop Downs:</strong> Navigation links to other pages.</li>
                <li><strong>Actions on the Page:</strong> Clicking navigation links will lead to other pages.</li>
                <li><strong>Special Notes:</strong> Real and positive testimonials can be very persuasive. The design should make them easy to read.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Dynamic Functionality on the Website:</h3>
            <p>Here is a description of the dynamic functionality I plan to implement using JavaScript/jQuery on the website:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Image Gallery on the Homepage using jQuery UI Lightbox:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Page:</strong> index.html</li>
                        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To showcase appealing images of the cafe in an interactive lightbox gallery. This will allow users to click on thumbnails to view larger images in an overlay, providing a more engaging visual experience without navigating away from the homepage.</li>
                        <li><strong>Example Implementation Idea:</strong> We will use the jQuery UI dialog widget styled to look like a lightbox, triggered by clicking on image thumbnails.</li>
                        <li><strong>Example URLs (for inspiration and plugins):</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li><a href="https://jqueryui.com/dialog/" target="_blank">jQuery UI Dialog Widget Documentation</a></li>
                                <li><a href="https://www.jqueryscript.net/gallery/" target="_blank">jQuery Image Gallery Plugins</a> (for potential alternative plugins)</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Basic Client-Side Form Validation on the Contact Page using jQuery:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Page:</strong> contact.html</li>
                        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To provide immediate feedback to users if they have not filled out the required fields (Name, Email, Message) or if the email format is invalid. This will improve user experience by catching errors before a (non-functional in this phase) submission attempt.</li>
                        <li><strong>Example Implementation Idea:</strong> We will use jQuery to select the form fields and add event listeners on submit. We'll check if the required fields are empty and use a regular expression to validate the email format, displaying error messages if necessary.</li>
                        <li><strong>Example URLs (for inspiration and plugins):</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li><a href="https://learn.jquery.com/forms/form-validation/" target="_blank">jQuery Learning Center - Form Validation</a></li>
                                <li><a href="https://jqueryvalidation.org/" target="_blank">jQuery Validation Plugin (more advanced option)</a></li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
